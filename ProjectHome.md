AGUIA is a web application front-end originally developed to manage clinical, demographic and biomolecular patient data collected during gastrointestinal clinical trials at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
<p>AGUIA is able to assemble automatically itself from the database S3DB, because S3DB generates an RDF where the domain is separated (ABox) of instantiation (TBox). For now, AGUIA is only able to understands the RDF where the ABox and TBox are distinct.<br>
<p>The AGUIA can be tested, but the user need have a valid user account and password in any S3DB deployment. If the user doesn't have a valid user account, he will can download it and he can works with the S3DB locally.<br>
